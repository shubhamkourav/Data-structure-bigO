# Big O Cheat Sheet:

## -Big Os-


**O(1)** Constant- no loops

**O(log N)** Logarithmic- usually searching algorithms have log n if they are sorted (Binary Search)

**O(n)** Linear- for loops, while loops through n items

**O(n log(n))** Log Liniear- usually sorting operations

**O(n^2)** Quadratic- every element in a collection needs to be compared to ever other element. Two nested loops

**O(2^n)** Exponential- recursive algorithms that solves a problem of size N

**O(n!)** Factorial- you are adding a loop for every element

  

**Iterating through half a collection is still O(n)
Two separate collections: O(a _ b)**

 ## - What can cause time in a function?-

Operations (+, -, _, /)

Comparisons (<, >, ==)

Looping (for, while)

Outside Function call (function())

## -Rule Book

**Rule 1**: Always worst Case
**Rule 2**: Remove Constants
**Rule 3**: Different inputs should have different variables. O(a+b). A and B arrays nested would be O(a\*b)
`+` for steps in order
`*` for nested steps
**Rule 4**: Drop Non-dominant terms

## -What causes Space complexity?-

- Variables
- Data Structures
- Function Call
- Allocations
